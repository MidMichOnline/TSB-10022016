From the [Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival 5K &amp; 10K Facebook page](http://www.shepherdhistory.org/business-directory/):

&gt; The Shepherd CrossCountry &amp; Shepherd Track teams are once again hosting a 3 race Holiday 5K series to help fund our spring break training trip. Each race is only $20 and it's just $50 if you sign up for the series. You get a great race and a give-a-way from each one and your support greatly helps the kids have an affordable trip.
The first race is the Haunted Trail 5K on October 22, followed by the Deerfield Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving November 24 and then the New Years Resolution Run January 1st. [Sign up for 1 or all!](https://runsignup.com/Race/MI/Shepherd/ShepherdHolidayRaceSeries)
