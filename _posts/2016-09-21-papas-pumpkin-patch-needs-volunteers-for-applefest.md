Hey Shepherd Students, do you like apple cider and doughnuts? Or are you in need of National Honor Society hours or community service hours? If you are, there is an opportunity this Saturday, September 24 at Papas Pumpkin Patch. It is called Applefest! It is from 9:30 to 4:00. Please sign up in the office by Friday. If you have any further questions, see Mrs. Yeagley.
